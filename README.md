## Description 
A walkthrough project supplied by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/?hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_cam=1578649861&hsa_grp=1147890658588794&hsa_ad&hsa_src=o&hsa_tgt=kwd-71743597220113%3Aloc-188&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&msclkid=96e9d238c1ea12152f48b6db168dd415&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CI%20-%20UK%20-%20Search%20-%20Brand&utm_term=code%20institute&utm_content=CI%20-%20UK%20-%20Search%20-%20Brand%20-%20Exact) which creates a challenge for the user to answer maths related questions correctly. The game offers addition, subtraction and multiplication questions which can be answered and checked. The correct answers accumulate and are displayed for the user to see; as are the incorrect answers.

## Languages

- CSS

## Future Improvements
The division game type is provided but doesn't work as a way to demonstrate 'else' actions but this game type is more challenging to code as it requires the user to answer with a float. This isn't very good UX as the answer could be to 9 decimal places for example. Making this game type work in a more user friendly way would be a good challenge for the future.

I did not create or write any of this code independently. It is purely an aid to practice JavaScript.
